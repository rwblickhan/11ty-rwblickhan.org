## San Francisco

- Saap Ver: Country-style Thai street food that's arguably my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. Their specialities include variants of papaya salad and extremely spicy sausage, but I'm personally fond of their crispy pork belly fried rice and duck curry.
- Delah Coffee: Yemeni coffee shop that stays open until 10pm (!). Trying a pot of the spiced coffee is a must, but I go back for the wide variety of pastries, especially the hot pink rose petal cake.
- Saigon Sandwich: Cash-only $4 banh mi, so you _know_ it's good.
