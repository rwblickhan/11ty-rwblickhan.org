## Talks

- [“What We Can Learn From Software History”](https://www.deconstructconf.com/2019/hillel-wayne-what-we-can-learn-from-software-history):
  - Hillel Wayne shows the power of the historical method by trying to answer a seemingly-simple question: why do software engineering interviews often ask “reverse a linked list”?

## Video Essays

- [“The Thing Chinese Dramas Can’t Get Right - Qin 古琴 V2.0”](https://youtu.be/B9vwDeXQApI):
  - I love nothing more than video essays where a nerd goes deep, deep down a rabbit hole that should matter only to them but somehow manages to find something interesting at the bottom, and this is one of my favorite examples. This channel typically reviews Chinese dramas, which often present characters incorrectly playing the classic Chinese instrument 古琴 (guqin) - much to the host’s frustration, as she’s actually a practicing guqin player. So, in this 16-minute video, she presents how a guqin is _actually_ performed, which ends up being a tidy musicological lesson about one of the most popular instruments in history.


## Music

- ["Take Me Home, Country Roads" in Minor Key](https://youtu.be/ZoVtHLxNVlU):
  - It turns out that if you transpose John Denver's "Take Me Home, Country Roads" to a minor key, it transforms from a meme song to an all-time-great nostalgic lament for a long-lost home. This version is far from perfect - you can tell the song is straining against its autotuning - but I still find myself drawn to it on a regular basis.
- ["Pyramid Song" 800% Slower](https://youtu.be/XiKWfcy-Z70):
  - "Pyramid Song" is not my favorite Radiohead song - it feels slightly too clever for its own good - but if you slow it down 800% it reveals one of the greatest ambient works of all time.
- ["Get Ready for the Grave" Mashup](https://youtu.be/JR3uz8rq4ng):
  - Look, it's a mashup of The Temptations' "Get Ready" and Black Sabbath's "Children of the Grave", and it's just... a really, really good song on its own merits?
- ["If I Can Dream" from Elvis' '68 Comeback Special](https://youtu.be/u-pP_dCenJA):
  - So hey, turns out this Elvis guy is a pretty good singer?
