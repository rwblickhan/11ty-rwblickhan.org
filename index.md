## About

Professionally, I am an iOS developer at [Asana](https://asana.com/). I have a bachelor's degree in computer science & mathematics from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), though generally speaking my interests lean towards the humanities (particularly history, cultural anthropology, political science, and economics).

I live in San Francisco with [my fiancée Sherry](http://sherryyuan.me) and our small canine companion Rooibos.

## What I'm Working On

### *A Prince of Foxes*

After noodling around with various [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org) projects during the pandemic, I'm finally tackling a "real" novel that I hope to publish one day, which I'm tentatively calling *A Prince of Foxes*. It's intended to be [sociological epic fantasy](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-real-reason-fans-hate-the-last-season-of-game-of-thrones/) in the vein of *Game of Thrones* or *Dune*. The first draft of 79,730 words is **done**! The second draft is currently 5,391 words.

### [EmomTimer](https://github.com/rwblickhan/EmomTimer)

I'm porting my fiancée's [EmomTimer Android app](https://github.com/frostyshadows/EmomTimer) to SwiftUI.

## What I'm Learning

### [*Economics of Money and Banking*](https://youtu.be/KNEouYM5wRE)

I'm watching a filmed Columbia course taught by Perry Merhling where he combines the economic and financial views of, well, money and banking.

## What I'm Reading

I'm currently reading Jane Jacobs' *The Death and Life of Great American Cities*, a classic of urban studies that I've so far managed to avoid. The rest of my reading is in my [books log](/books).

## What I'm Watching

I most recently watched *Nope* in theatres. It was definitely interesting, but I feel like the subtext worked better than the text. The rest of my watching is in my [films log](/films).

## Other Stuff

* Sometimes I [take pictures](/gallery)!
* I collect some of my [favorite quotes](/quotes).
* I write up some of my [favorite recipes](/recipes), mostly for my own use.

## Colophon

This site is generated with the [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator. It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling and [Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com) as the main font. It's served out of an [AWS S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) behind [Cloudflare's CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/), with the infrastructure managed by [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com).

You can find out more about how I built a slightly older version of this site in [this post](/technical/2022-site) and see the full source on [Github](https://github.com/rwblickhan/11ty-rwblickhan.org).
