## About

Professionally, I am an iOS developer at [Asana](https://asana.com/). I have a bachelor's degree in computer science & mathematics from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), though generally speaking my interests lean towards the humanities (particularly literature, history, cultural anthropology, political science, and economics).

I live in San Francisco with [my fiancée Sherry](http://sherryyuan.me) and our small canine companion Rooibos.

## What I'm Working On

### *Dreams of an Alien God*

Just in time for Halloween, I recently finished a 20,000-word "dummy draft" of a horror story about a spooky hotel. I'll be expanding this into a real draft in the coming weeks.

### "Three Lies"

I wrote a surreal fantasy short story about a world where you only get three lies. I'm collecting beta feedback right now with the intent of throwing it into the submission grinder Soon™️.

### [EmomTimer](https://github.com/rwblickhan/EmomTimer)

I'm porting my fiancée's [EmomTimer Android app](https://github.com/frostyshadows/EmomTimer) to SwiftUI.

### Photography

I'm trying to get more serious about photography, although I'm just using a trusty iPhone 14 Pro as my camera. You can check out the [gallery](/gallery) for my most recent pictures.

## Colophon

This site is generated with the [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator. It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling and [Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com) as the main font. It's served out of an [AWS S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) behind [Cloudflare's CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/), with the infrastructure managed by [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com).

You can find out more about how I built a slightly older version of this site in [this post](/technical/2022-site) and see the full source on [Github](https://github.com/rwblickhan/11ty-rwblickhan.org).
