## About

Professionally, I am an iOS developer at [Asana](https://asana.com/). I have a bachelor's degree in computer science & mathematics from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), though generally speaking my interests lean towards the humanities (particularly history, cultural anthropology, political science, and economics).

I live in San Francisco with [my fiancée Sherry](http://sherryyuan.me) and our small canine companion Rooibos.

## What I'm Working On

### *Dreams of an Alien God*

I'm kicking off a book that's long been on my backlog. This one's a horror novel about a spooky hotel. I'm hoping to have a "dummy draft" ready by end of October (just in time for Halloween!).

### [EmomTimer](https://github.com/rwblickhan/EmomTimer)

I'm porting my fiancée's [EmomTimer Android app](https://github.com/frostyshadows/EmomTimer) to SwiftUI.

## What I'm Learning

### [*Economics of Money and Banking*](https://youtu.be/KNEouYM5wRE)

I'm watching a filmed Columbia course taught by Perry Merhling where he combines the economic and financial views of, well, money and banking.

## Colophon

This site is generated with the [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator. It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling and [Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com) as the main font. It's served out of an [AWS S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) behind [Cloudflare's CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/), with the infrastructure managed by [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com).

You can find out more about how I built a slightly older version of this site in [this post](/technical/2022-site) and see the full source on [Github](https://github.com/rwblickhan/11ty-rwblickhan.org).
